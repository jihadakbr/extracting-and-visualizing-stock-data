## Objective

My objective is to complete a series of tasks related to stock data analysis and visualization. Firstly, I will define a function that enables me to create graphs. Then, I will use yfinance to extract stock data for Tesla in Question 1 and GameStop in Question 3. In Questions 2 and 4, I will utilize webscraping techniques to extract revenue data for Tesla and GameStop, respectively. Subsequently, I will plot the stock graph for Tesla in Question 5 and the stock graph for GameStop in Question 6. By accomplishing these tasks, I aim to enhance my skills in data extraction, visualization, and analysis, particularly in the context of financial data from diverse sources.
